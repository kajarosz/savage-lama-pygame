# savage-lama-pygame
My first pygame in Python.

You are savage lama and your greatest enemies are those nasty chickens running everywhere! You can avoid them like a coward or you can face them like a savage. Killing chickens is really simple - just jump on them. They won't handle your fluf. Remember it's a BYOB party, so you need to collect some potions on your way. Take one and you will be on fire running over chickens like there's no tomorrow. If any of these bastards hurts you, just make your belly full and soon you will get your power back!

Let me know, if you enjoyed the game!
